# Machine-learning-applications-in-wireless-communication
In today's digital age, wireless communication is a critical aspect of our daily lives. In this project, we aim to explore machine learning techniques to build a receiver and transmitter that can efficiently transmit an array of numbers wirelessly. By utilizing advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques, we will develop a system that can accurately detect and decode transmissions, even in the presence of noise and interference. With this project, we hope to contribute to the advancement of wireless communication technology and improve its reliability and efficiency.
